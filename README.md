# 🍽️ MealMate

**MealMate** is a simple calorie and protein tracker built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Users can search for foods from a predefined local list, add them to their meal, and view the total calories and protein for their current meal — all without using any backend or external APIs.

This project was built to showcase clean UI, DOM manipulation, and responsive design with no frameworks or dependencies.
